1. When the B join line is removed, the prgram does not wait for the B thread to finish. 
Therefore, the output from B isn't taken into the counter and the value of cout is not 100 sometimes.


Sample Outputs:
Starting A
Starting B
count: 100

Starting A
Starting B
count: 81

Starting A
Starting B
count: 90

2.When the A join line is removed, the program does not wait for the A thread to finish.
Therefore, the output from A isn't taken into the counter and the value of cout is not 100 sometimes.

Sample Outputs:
Starting A
Starting B
count: 65


Starting A
Starting B
count: 91

Starting A
Starting B
count: 100

3. When both join lines are removed, the output is 0. 
This is because the threads are unable to run in that short period of time and the program is not exceuting any of them.

Sample Output:
Starting A
Starting B
count: 0
